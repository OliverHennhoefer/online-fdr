class AlphaInvestingFosterStine(AbstractOnlineTest):
    """Implements the original version of Alpha Investing[1]_.

    The original (non-generalized) method only controls the mFDR.

    Strictly spoken, this version does not conform to the overall
    framework of 'Generalized Alpha Investing' as the alpha wealth
    does not get depleted by rejections. For 'Generalized Alpha
    Investing' the alpha wealth gets reduced iteratively, regardless
    of whether a rejection was made (a reward was granted) or not.

    Setting the parameter 'gen[eralized]' to True makes the online
    test conform to the framework of 'Generalized Alpha Investing'.
    This variant controls provably controls FDR for independent p-values.

    The alpha levels a(j) can be chosen arbitrarily, as long as they
    satisfy: a(j)/(a(j) - 1) <= W(j-1) (see validity.check_wealth())
    This guarantees that the available wealth does not turn negative.
    Here, the implementation is based on [1]_.

    Implemented default fallbacks in the constructor are based on [1]_.
